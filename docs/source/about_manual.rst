About manual
============

The pilight manual is a community driven project open for everyone to participate in. The goal is to provide a multi-lingual and professional software manual for each pilight release. All users are invited to add, edit, or replace content to their best effort. If you want to contribute then also add your name in the contributor list below.

The pilight manual is consists of various so called RestructuredText documents.

These individual documents are then combined into a master document. The master documents are converted into the final pilight manual using Sphinx
